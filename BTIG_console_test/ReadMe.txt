Here are the steps to build and run this project:

1. Execute the attached SQL script "BTIG_sample.sql", which will create a
   BTIG_sample database and all required tables and stored procedures.

2. Build and run the "BTIG_console_test" application, passing it a directory
   path from which the application will read text files. Note that the SQL
   connection string is found in the App.config of the console application.

3. Finally, try the various parameters of the "BTIG_console_test" application,
   which will produce .csv files with statistics about the text data.
